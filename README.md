Cloud based IPS Honeypot based on Snort Signatures

Objective: 

Design and deploy a Cloud-based IPS Honeypot using Snort Signatures for proactive threat detection and analysis.



Requirements -

1. Cloud Infrastructure:

Choose a provider (e.g., Google Cloud Platform) and deploy a cluster instance with sufficient resources for Snort and related components. - Use terraform

2. Snort Installation and Configuration:

Install Snort on the Cloud VM following official installation guides for the selected operating system.
Configure Snort with the latest signatures and rules for effective intrusion detection.

3. Honeypot Configuration:

Define the honeypot configuration, emulating specific services (e.g., web server, FTP, SSH) to attract potential threats.

4. Snort Configuration:

Configure Snort to monitor and log traffic related to these emulated services. - Script this

5. Cloud Security Group/Firewall Rules:

Configure provider security group or firewall rules to allow traffic to the honeypot.
Restrict access to necessary ports, ensuring a controlled environment.

6. Configure Logging and Analysis on the IPS:

Set up centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk for Snort alerts and logs.
Implement log rotation and retention policies for efficient analysis.

7. Alert Detection Mechanisms:

Configure Snort to generate alerts for suspicious activities.
Implement alerting mechanisms, such as email notifications or webhooks, to receive timely notifications.

8. Updates {Software, Incident response and monitoring}:

Keep Snort rules and signatures up-to-date to enhance threat detection capabilities.
Schedule regular updates and maintenance for the honeypot infrastructure.
Implement monitoring for the honeypot infrastructure and regularly review logs.



Legal and Ethical Considerations -

Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards when deploying a honeypot. Obtain necessary permissions and approvals.
